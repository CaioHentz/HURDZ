Placeholder assets directory.

This project generates simple placeholder textures (player, zombie, bullet, blood, grass) at runtime using Phaser graphics.
No external image files are required for the game to run.

If you want to replace them with real images, place files here and load them in MainScene.preload() using this.load.image().
Suggested filenames (as per initial structure):
- player.png
- zombie.png
- bullet.png
